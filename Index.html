            <pre style="font-size:15px;">
                I am in my second year of university at Portsmouth.I am a person who loves learning about different softwares and 
                programs. I first came into contact with programming through Scratch around the age of 8 and have been actively 
                learning a language since. Here are some of the things I've worked on in the past

            <h2 style="font-size:40px;">Minecraft Custom Origins Mod:</h2>
            <pre style="font-size:15px;">
                This is one of the first large scale projects I worked on and the first not using Python, I took an existing 
                Minecraft Mod called the Origins Mod that adds 'origins' which give each player a set of unique powers. I had a 
                group of friends each provide me with a custom origin they wanted to play as and coded them within two weeks while 
                using the required language for the first time. This was an exciting challenge that taught me a lot of skills I used
                in later projects. Here are some examples of what I made:

            <h2 style="font-size:40px;">College Computer Science Project:</h2>
            <pre style="font-size:15px;">
                For my college computer science project I created a game using the Python library PyGame. It featured a randomly 
                generated grid that contained no dead ends, it then spawned enemies throughout the map that would pathfind towards 
                the player before shooting at them, alongside traps that would activate when walked near. Unfortunately I've lost the 
                final version of the program, however here is an image of one a late version that had traps just being implemented:

            <h2 style="font-size:40px;">University first year programming project</h2>
            <pre style="font-size:15px;">
                Arguably a bit less impressive than some of my previous projects and definitely a lot less flashy, this project 
                displays a personal triumph as it was coded in tkinter which is a Python library I had previously struggled with in High 
                School. The ease with which I coded this program directly showed the progress I had made and greatly increased my 
                confidence and commitment to constant improvement.

            <h2 style="font-size:40px;">Learning 3D modelling through Blender</h2>
            <pre style="font-size:15px;">
                By all accounts I should not have tried to learn 3D modelling, I have never really succeeded with anything artistic and 
                navigating the 3D space makes my head hurt. Despite my misgivings I decided to give it a try and... 
                
                I was awful. 
                
                That being said, I found myself enjoying the creative process and decided to continue trying to tap into the skillset 
                I'd never used before. A couple months down the line and I find myself relatively proud of the skills I've developed. As 
                of 15/11/2023 this is my latest creation:
