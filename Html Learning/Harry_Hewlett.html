<pre style="font-size:15px;">
Widely accredited as the 4th deadly sin, I have chosen to gift you a glimpse into my life through this page, from 
my early years to my prime. I was able to walk from the age of 4 months, allowing me to partake in the March on 
Washington. Having earned the noble prize in physics by the age of 4, I was able to advise Stephen Hawking on his 
research into black holes.

By my tween years I had been banned from the city of Las Vegas due to fear of my extraordinary luck, so instead 
spent 2 years touring the world while helping the poor, with Mother Theresa as my apprentice.

While I have been known to have spawned many legends such as King Arthur, Robin Hood and the Loch Ness Monster my 
deeds are often miscredited due to my incredibly humble nature, these include landing a plane on the Hudson River, 
ending apartheid and extincting the dinosaurs.

Overall, the lesson I would like to leave you with, is never be afraid to succeed, unless failure is an option.
